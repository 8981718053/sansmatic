**A Theoretical Framework for a Universal, Self-Verifying Language System**

## 🌌 Abstract
**Sansmatic** is a proposed *formal framework* that fuses the **precision of Sanskrit grammar** with the **rigor of mathematical logic**.  
Its goal: to create the **first universal, self-verifying language system** where every expression is:  

1. **Grammatically well-formed** (Paninian generative grammar rules).  
2. **Logically truth-bound** (dependently-typed proofs).  
3. **Executable only if consistent** (a Sansmatic VM).  

This makes Sansmatic a candidate **metalanguage** for AI alignment, verified programming, unambiguous law, and scientific unification.

## 📚 Classification
- **Type:** Theoretical framework (theory-in-development).  
- **Status:** v0.1 — Initial definition, laws, and prototype grammar.  
- **Nature:** Synthetic theory (fusion of formal linguistics + mathematical logic).

## 🔑 Core Principles (Primitives)
- `DEFINE <Concept>` → declare entities or systems.  
- `ASSERT <Statement>` → assert with attached proof.  
- `IF <Condition> THEN <Consequence>` → logical implication.  
- `IS`, `HAS` → ontological operators.  
- `PROOF <id>` → reference to machine-checkable proof.  
- `EVALUATE <Expr>` → execute if all proof obligations satisfied.

## ⚖️ The Five Fundamental Laws of Sansmatic
1. **Law of Well-Formedness**  
   Every expression must conform to Paninian-style grammar; malformed expressions are invalid.  

2. **Law of Proof-Binding**  
   Every assertion must be accompanied by a machine-checkable proof or explicit proof obligation.  

3. **Law of Non-Ambiguity**  
   Each valid expression maps to exactly one canonical parse and meaning.  

4. **Law of Preservation**  
   Proofs and invariants remain preserved across transformations, compilation, and execution.  

5. **Law of Consistency Enforcement**  
   Contradictions halt or reject execution — nonsense cannot run.
